# Autonomous Enterprise Runtime

![Autonomous Enterprise Runtime Banner](assets/banner.png)

Runtime infrastructure patterns for building safe, observable, and resilient autonomous enterprise systems.

---

## 🚀 Why This Repository Exists

Most discussions around AI agents focus on:
- prompts
- models
- workflows
- orchestration frameworks

But production autonomous systems require something much deeper:

# Runtime Infrastructure

AI agents are increasingly behaving less like isolated applications and more like continuously operating distributed systems.

That introduces new architectural requirements:

- scheduling
- orchestration
- memory management
- runtime governance
- observability
- resilience engineering
- bounded autonomy

This repository explores the engineering patterns required to build operating systems for autonomous enterprises.

# 🧠 Core Thesis

> AI agents without runtime infrastructure are equivalent to applications without operating systems.

Reliable autonomous systems require:
- execution boundaries
- policy enforcement
- traceability
- recovery systems
- governance planes

—not just smarter models.

## 🔧 Modules

### 1. runtime_scheduler

Simulates foundational execution and recovery runtime infrastructure for autonomous agent clusters.

* **Demonstrates**: Task scheduling priority queues, inline policy validations (costs & restricted tools), trace telemetry, and self-healing recovery handlers (retries, backoff, LLM fallbacks, HITL).
* **Run command**:
  ```bash
  python3 -m runtime_scheduler.simulator
  ```

### 2. coordination_bus

Simulates a decentralized event-driven coordination plane enabling secure, audited, and moderated agent-to-agent interactions.

* **Demonstrates**: Pub-sub event propagation, publisher verification policies, direct-path interaction checks, and arbitration mechanisms for multi-agent conflicts.
* **Run command**:
  ```bash
  python3 -m coordination_bus.simulator
  ```
### 3. memory_systems

Simulates a multi-layered cognitive memory system for agents modeled beyond simple RAG frameworks.

* **Demonstrates**: Working memory caches, episodic experience logs (experience-based retrieval), triplet-based semantic policy systems, concurrency lock coordination, and background memory consolidation syncs.
* **Run command**:
  ```bash
  python3 -m memory_systems.simulator
  ```
